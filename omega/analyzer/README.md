# Omega Analyzer

The Omega Analyzer is a self-contained container image that has a broad set of security tools
preinstalled, along with an orchestration script to run those tools against a target and
aggregate the results.

While it can be used interactively, it's primary purpose is to be run from the host, with
output send to a mapped directory.

## Building

To build the container image, just run `build.ps1` or `docker build` with your
chosen tag, from this directory. The build script contains cache burst parameter,
pass in `-Force` to `build.ps1` to re-build all layers.

**This will take a long time.** As part of the build, we download CodeQL and pre-compile
all queries (to make later analysis faster). This can take up to a few hours on typical
hardware.

We're exploring making the pre-built image available.

Alternatively, can use the following command to build from docker

```sh
docker build -t openssf/omega-toolshed:$(grep -E '^LABEL version.*' Dockerfile | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d '"') . -f Dockerfile

# The command `$(grep -E '^LABEL version.*' Dockerfile | cut -d= -f2 | tr -d '"')` is responsible for searching for the version number on the Dockerfile and using that as the tag on Docker
```

### Troubleshooting steps

#### MacOS M1 Chip
If using a Mac OSX with the latest Docker Desktop (4.15 as of writing), `docker build build.ps1` will shoot out several error messages.

Make sure to create `/etc/apt/` with sudo user

Download and install
* `wget` with `brew install wget`
* `dkpg` with `brew install dpkg`
* .NET core with `brew install mono-libgdiplus`

There is a known issue with [M1 Apple chip on MacOS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71040681/qemu-x86-64-could-not-open-lib64-ld-linux-x86-64-so-2-no-such-file-or-direc), which would produce the error when running

```qemu-x86_64: Could not open '/lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2': No such file or directory```

The following two options are available to work around this issue:
1. Set the DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM environment variable to linux/amd64

`export DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64`
2. In the FROM section of the Dockerfile, line 1, modify to the following

`FROM --platform=linux/amd64 mcr.microsoft.com/mirror/docker/library/ubuntu:22.04`

## Running

To run the image, navigate to the `worker` directory and run the `run-analysis-complete.ps1`
script with relevant parameters:

```powershell
run-analysis-complete.ps1 -PackageUrl "pkg:npm/left-pad@1.3.0"
                 -PreviousVersion "1.2.0"
                 -OutputDirectoryName "output"
```

The result will be a directory containing all output files from the analysis placed into
a subdirectory within `output` and if the results were "clean", a security review placed
in `security-reviews`.

You can also run the image directly (which will not include reproducibility or a security review):

```sh
docker run --rm -it --mount type=bind,source=/tmp/output_dir,target=/opt/export openssf/omega-toolshed:latest pkg:npm/left-pad@1.3.0 1.2.0
```

### Standalone

To run this as a standalone from a **built** image, run the following:

```sh
# Template of command
docker run --rm -v <LOCAL_COMPUTER_DIR>:/opt/export/<PKG_DIR> --env-file .env openssf/omega-toolshed:latest pkg:<PKG_FORMAT>
```

```sh
# Example of command
docker run --rm -v ./npm/left-pad/:/opt/export/npm/left-pad/1.3.0 --env-file .env openssf/omega-toolshed:latest pkg:npm/left-pad@1.3.0
```
The result will be a directory containing all output files from the analysis placed into
a directory on your local machine (not the container) in `./npm/left-pad`. 

An example of the [.env](./worker/.env.example) should contain `librariesIO` api key to get the packages from the net. Simply create an account on libraries IO to get the API key.

<!--
```sh
# For some extra hacking on the container, use this
docker run --rm --entrypoint /bin/bash --env-file .env openssf/omega-toolshed:latest pkg:<PKG_FORMAT>
```
-->

### Local Usage
There are currently 2 ways of getting the tar file to run the analyzer locally, through libraries.io or github. Here is a working example of one might have to wget to get it on the container. Then you can use the `?local_source=true` from [./worker/tools/runtools.sh](./worker/tools/runtools.sh) to check for packages. Naturally, as virtue of running it locally, you lose the ability to use `@latest` as the `<version_number>`in the package format (`pkg:npm/left-pad@<version_number>`) and need to explicitly write the verison number

Here's an wget example using `chalk` from `npm` (as of Aug 2023):
| Source       | (wget) Pattern
| :----------- | :-------
| libraries.io | https://registry.npmjs.org/chalk/-/chalk-5.3.0.tgz 
| Github       | https://github.com/chalk/chalk/archive/refs/tags/v5.3.0.tar.gz



### Usage with the Omega Triage Portal
- If you are running it locally:
```bash
docker run --env-file <.env file> --net="host" --rm -it openssf/omega-toolshed -u <username> -p <password> -t <triage portal endpoint> "pkg:<pkg_name>"
```
- Need the extra `--net="host"` so that docker can speak to the portal running on the host machine
