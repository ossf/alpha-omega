# Alpha-Omega Engagement: Rust Foundation 

First, thank you to Alpha-Omega for supporting the Rust Foundation.

The purpose of the Rust Foundation’s engagement with Alpha-Omega engagement is to provide security resources to the Rust Project and ecosystem via the Foundation’s [security initiative](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/2022-09-13-rust-foundation-establishes-security-team/). 

The Rust Foundation’s Security Initiative is a larger program funded and resourced by Alpha-Omega, JFrog and other partners. Using the [Open Source Software Software Security Mobilization Plan](https://openssf.org/oss-security-mobilization-plan/) as one piece of guidance, the focus of the work will be in key security areas, including:

* Hiring a dedicated security engineer to support the initiative
* A security audit and threat modeling exercises to identify how security can be economically maintained going forward.
* Advocate for security practices across the Rust landscape, including Cargo and [Crates.io](https://crates.io).
* Development of tools and features based on security research recommendations.
* Development of documentation to demystify security practices and encourage best practice in the Rust ecosystem.
* Development of a security toolkit that can be accessed and used universally.
* Making a steady stream of Rust ecosystem fixes that were directly identified through security research, including the use of developed tools and toolkits.
* Participation in drafting a proposal to define a mechanism for certifying Rust code (e.g., crates) as officially audited for security vulnerabilities.
* A number of security-focused [Community Grant Program](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/grants/) recipients are mentored and developed into active and high capacity security maintainers.


## Timeline

This engagement started in September 2022 and is expected to continue through at least all of 2023.
