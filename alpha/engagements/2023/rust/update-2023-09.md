There was plenty of PTO for the engineering staff at the Rust Foundation, but there are still some substantive updates.

The big news was the malicious crate discovery that sent tokens and keys to a Telegram channel. The attack vector was typo squatting of safe and benign crates. There will be an [Inside Rust](https://blog.rust-lang.org/inside-rust/) blog post detailing the situation and response, but [Phylum](https://www.phylum.io/) was key in the response. They [posted](https://blog.phylum.io/rust-malware-staged-on-crates-io/) about how they worked with the Rust Foundation and crates.io team to detect and remove the crates in question. The Foundation is looking at proposing some potential engineering efforts to help with malware detection - for example, having detection tooling that runs during crate publishing.

## Threat Modeling

Here is the progress on the four threat models being developed by the Rust Foundation:

1. **Crates ecosystem**: Public publication at or around Rust Global.
2. **Rust Infrastructure**: About to be circulated privately to the security-initiative working group
3. **crates.io**: Outline complete. First threat ranking in progress.
4. **Rust Project**: Potential outline developed.

## Engineering

The technical staff at the Rust Foundation continues to work on engineering efforts directly related to security:

### Crate signing

Crate signing is an important part to a holistic security strategy for the Rust ecosystem. Walter is working on a public key infrastructure (PKI) RFC draft to be published and reviewed by the crates.io team and the community.

### Painter

[Painter](https://github.com/rustfoundation/painter) is now over 100 stars on GitHub and has been updated with expanded coverage. There is support now for binary dependencies, syscrate, and external library static analysis, brining Painter's coverage of the crate ecosystem from 40% to 70%.

### Wiz Deployment

[Wiz](https://www.wiz.io/) has been deployed into production and is now providing alerts to the Rust Project infrastructure team. Examples of alerts include root tokens accessing resource and when a new account is added to the root.

### Limit Multiple Crate Manifests

To ensure consistency across all crates and to synchronize with cargo semantics, crates [now rejects](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/7008) packages that have multiple cargo.toml manifests. 

### Overriding Relative Paths

There has been an [issue raised](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues/3461) about how relative path overrides permit a freshly downloaded source tree to execute arbitrary code on a `rustup` command that executes a binary from a configured toolchain.

The proposed solution here is to rollback recent relative path work and use the separate trusted directory functionality to gate all access to path based toolchain overrides.

### Faster checks on crates reverse dependencies

While not directly related to security, a community member [submitted an improvement](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/6910) to the query that finds reverse dependencies for a crate. The improvement allows a single crate dependency query to happen in an order of magnitude faster than before. 

### Pre-compiled binaries

The [controversy](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/rust-devs-push-back-as-serde-project-ships-precompiled-binaries/) over [shipping the `serde_derive` macro as a pre-compiled binary](https://github.com/serde-rs/serde/issues/2538#issuecomment-1654783988) is raising a discussion on how best to approach pre-compiled binaries as a whole. What potential solutions, if any, or engineering to come out of this is still to be determined.

## Community

The [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3463) proposed to update the Terms of Use for crates.io is still on going. This RFC is based on prior work by other package managers such as PyPI and npm. The main motivation for this RFC is to give the crates.io team a fixed set of rules to determine if a project is using crates.io in a reasonable way, or if the user should get a warning and the project potentially be removed. It is mostly codifying the existing practices of the team, except for being more strict regarding name squatting.

The Rust Foundation is hosting its [first Rust Global event](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/news/rust-foundation-to-host-inaugural-rust-global-event-at-wasmcon-2023/) at WASMCon 2023 on 6 September 2023. The [schedule](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/rust-global/) is final and the Rust Foundation is hosting a technical panel with Walter Pearce, Adam Harvey and Joel Marcey.

[RustConf](https://rustconf.com/) will be held from 12-15 September. Most of the Foundation staff will be attending, including with presentations from its infrastructure engineer, Jan David Nose, and community advocate (and planner of the event), Sage Griffin.
