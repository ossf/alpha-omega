# Update 2023-08

## releases.jquery.com

Unreleased "git" assets were previously saved from Jenkins job builds directly to one of the WordPress servers. There is now a new "filestash" server for this purpose. All Jenkins jobs have been updated to sync assets to this server instead. The WordPress servers are now stateless and interchangeable. Tarsnap backups were also enabled for the filestash server.

## Documentation sites

Last month, all 20 documentation sites had their "stage" domains switched to the new "wp-02.stage" server.

New production servers (wp-04 and wp-05) have now been deployed with all 20 documentation sites provisioned, running Debian 12, PHP 8.2, and WordPress 6.

The first three production domains of doc sites have switched to these new servers and are now live:
- https://learn.jquery.com/
- https://jquerymobile.com/
- https://api.jquerymobile.com/

### meetings.jquery.org

The homepage for https://meetings.jquery.org has been fixed. There were some broken links, including an outdated iframe that loaded Google calendar. jQuery Team meetings are now on the Matrix platform at https://app.element.io/#/room/#jquery_meeting:gitter.im. The old IRC links have been removed.

## Decomission CLA droplets

jQuery has been using the [Linux CLA service](https://github.com/apps/linux-foundation-easycla) for a while now. There are two legacy CLA server droplets that are no longer needed. The CLA data has been extracted and saved to a private repo. The droplets will be decommissioned.

## Decommission view-01 droplet

Some upgrades were made to [themeroller](https://github.com/jquery/themeroller.jquerymobile.com) to prepare it for migration to a new server:
- Upgraded to PHP 7
- Removed broken Adobe Kuler integration
- Removed legacy share functionality
- added `ZIPDIR` option to change storage location, allowing more secure deployment with a read-only document root

The sites https://demos.jquerymobile.com and https://themeroller.jquerymobile.com/ are now migrated to the new miscweb-01 droplet. The view-01 droplet and its DNS entries have been deleted.

## jQuery Core

### grunt migration

#### grunt lint

The Core team has continued work to migrate all tasks run in Grunt to npm scripts. Last month, work was mainly focused on `grunt lint`. `npm run lint` now uses `eslint` directly and the config format has been updated to the new "flat" config. However, there is still a blocker on [eslint-plugin-import](https://github.com/import-js/eslint-plugin-import/pull/2829) to support the new config format. It mainly affects one rule (`import/no-unused-modules`). We're considering disabling the rule for now and re-enabling it once the plugin is updated.

#### grunt build (and minify, dist, compare_size, etc.)

The Core team has also begun work to migrate `grunt build` to npm scripts. This is a more complex task as it involves several subtasks (`minify`, `dist`, `compare_size`, etc.). It also involved building a new command line tool for creating custom builds of jQuery, which before used a custom grunt task. The new tool uses [yargs](https://yargs.js.org/) to parse command line arguments. The new `minify` task uses `@swc/core`. The new `dist` task is much the same as the old one. It verifies that the built files are ascii-only and do not contain carriage returns. `grunt-compare-size` did not have a direct equivalent, so it was replaced with a custom script. That script is still in progress.

#### grunt test

This task involves migrating away from multiple deprecated or minimally-maintained packages, including karma, grunt, and testswarm. jQuery Core uses browserstack to run QUnit tests in all its supported browsers. The test runs are triggered (or *were* triggered) using an old jQuery Jenkins instance. The goal is to migrate these tests to run in GitHub actions instead.

However, browserstack support for QUnit has not been maintained and bindings for QUnit have not been added to browserstack's latest SDK. We're currently in contact with browserstack's support team to explore options.

## jQuery CDN

The jQuery CDN is the process of being migrated from StackPath to Fastly and everything should be ready.

https://codeorigin.jquery.com/, an alias for the main https://code.jquery.com site, has already been moved as a canary test. It receives some traffic, but the major migration will be moving https://code.jquery.com itself. This should be done in the next few weeks.

## Research and Web Modernization Campaign

The team continues to meet weekly to build out a targeted campaign using the results of the IDC research to shape messaging and call-to-action across a variety of industry verticals.
