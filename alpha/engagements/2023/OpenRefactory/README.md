# Alpha Engagement: OpenRefactory

OpenRefactory thanks Alpha-Omega for supporting the project to report vulnerabilities at scale.

OpenRefactory will work alongside with Alpha-Omega project’s principals to report security vulnerabilities at scale in open source projects and work with the maintainers to get the vulnerabilities fixed:

1. OpenRefactory will analyze open source software written in two languages: Java and Python. The goal is to analyze top 10,000 open source projects in these languages with OpenRefactory’s own [Intelligent Code Repair (iCR)](https://www.openrefactory.com/technology/) tool as well as the [Omega Analyzer](https://github.com/ossf/alpha-omega/tree/main/omega/analyzer).
2. OpenRefactory will concentrate on the following critical security categories: [SQL Injection](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/79.html), [Command Injection](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/77.html), [Path Manipulation](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html), [Deserialization](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html), [XML External Entity (XXE) Injection](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/611.html). In future, the proposed work will extend into security hardening and other kinds of bugs as well.
3. OpenRefactory will use a portal to triage bug reports from their proprietary tool iCR (Intelligent Code Repair) and other tools from the Omega toolchain.
4. Reports will include a range of problems which will require manual review.
5. OpenRefactory will triage manually and follow the model outbound vulnerability disclosure policy to report the bugs in a responsible manner.
6. OpenRefactory will follow the submissions and work with the maintainers to correct the issues.


The following KPIs will be tracked:

* The total number of projects that have ben analyzed
* The total number of issues that have been reported as True Positives
* The number of those reported issues for which exploit code was created
* The number of those reported issues for which fixes have been generated
* How many reports have been accepted?
* How many reports have been rejected?
* The number of "clean" projects where no security issues were uncovered


## Timeline

This engagement started in July 2023. The metrics will be reviewed in December 2023 and the project is expected to continue in 2024 and 2025.
