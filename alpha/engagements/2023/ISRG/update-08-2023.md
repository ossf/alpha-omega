# Rustls

Our goal is to build a safer TLS library that can largely replace OpenSSL over time. The headline features of the new library, [Rustls](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/), are performance and memory safety.

We are making great progress. The community is also growing rapidly, with new contributors showing up regularly and largely representing new consumers of Rustls.

The pluggable cryptography implementation started to land in August and work is under way to add support for [aws-lc-rs](https://github.com/aws/aws-lc-rs). This has been a huge amount of work. We expect the pluggable cryptography implementation and aws-lc-rs integration to be completed within the next month. We are waiting on guidance from the aws-lc-rs team regarding finalizing FIPS support.

Adolfo Ochogavia is making great progress on benchmarking. His work has started to land.

Ferrous Systems has [published an RFC](https://github.com/rustls/rustls/pull/1420) for caller managed buffers, asynchronous APIs, and no-std support. Implementation will start shortly.

Previously, work under Prossimo contracts has led to:

* A major new release [announced on March 30th](https://www.memorysafety.org/blog/rustls-new-features/), adding support for some of the most heavily requested features, including IP address support, C.4 session caching, and a number of API improvements. 
* A release on July 7 adding CRL support, particularly important for client certificate support.
* Numerous other fixes and improvements along the way.


# Rust for Linux 
Our goal is to make Rust a supported second language for Linux kernel development, and to foster the creation of drivers and modules written in Rust.

The primary maintainer of Rust for Linux, Miguel Ojeda, has been working full time under contract with Prossimo since April of 2021.

Linux v6.5 was released late August which includes
the previous [Rust
PR](https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20230618161558.1051269-1-ojeda@kernel.org/)
as well as a few fixes during the cycle.

The merge window for Linux v6.6 has started and it is expected to
include the next set of changes, [already sent to Linus
Torvalds](https://lore.kernel.org/rust-for-linux/20230824214024.608618-1-ojeda@kernel.org/),
including improvements to the infrastructure, upgrades to the
toolchain and a set of pinned-init API improvements.

The KUnit series, which adds support for testing Rust code within
documentation as KUnit tests, landed as expected in the
kselftest/kunit tree, and it is likely it will be sent to Linus Torvalds during this
merge window.

The Rust subsystem has two more reviewers officially listed in the
`MAINTAINERS` file of the kernel, from Google and Samsung. This shows
that there is a growing amount of companies giving support with actual
engineering time.

The kernel infrastructure maintainers have agreed to publish the Rust
code documentation into a URL like https://rust.docs.kernel.org. This
is the documentation generated by `rustdoc` containing the internal
kernel APIs, not the general documents which are already published at
<https://docs.kernel.org/rust/>.

Engineers from two different companies have started collaborating to
bring the first filesystem abstractions to the kernel. 

The Rust for Linux team had its first "Maintainers & Reviewers"
meeting, intended for discussion around patch queue management and
other maintenance topics. This is in addition to our usual "Weekly
Meetings", which focus on technical discussion.

Tectonics 2023: ISRG's Prossimo project will [host an event](https://tectonics.memorysafety.org/) on November 2nd 2023 in San Francisco to advance the development and adoption of Rustls, Rust for Linux, and other memory safe software. Registration will open soon. 

Linux Plumbers Conference 2023: [new blog post](https://lpc.events/blog/current/index.php/2023/07/30/rust-mc-cfp/) was published with areas of topic focus.
