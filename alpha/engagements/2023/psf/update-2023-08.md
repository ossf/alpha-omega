## Highlight: Python Software Foundation authorized as a CVE Numbering Authority

- Python Software Foundation was authorized as a CVE Numbering Authority on August 29th.
  - [CVE Press Release](https://www.cve.org/Media/News/item/news/2023/08/29/Python-Software-Foundation-Added-as-CNA)
  - [Python Software Foundation Announcement](https://pyfound.blogspot.com/2023/08/psf-authorized-as-cna.html)
- Developed [training regiment](https://gist.github.com/sethmlarson/44cf38a73b304b1a08bd34ba62355a81) to prepare CNA staff for onboarding call and test exercises.
- Submitted test exercises for CVE ID and Record creation as a part of CVE onboarding.
- Published [updated vulnerability disclosure documentation](python.org/dev/security/) on python.org.
- Revitalized the [security-announce@python.org mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman3/lists/security-announce.python.org/) for security advisories.
- Authored the PSF announcement blog post and socials according to CVE press standards.
- Drafting guidance for joining the CNA Program for Open Source orgs and projects to
  be submitted to the OpenSSF Vulnerability Disclosures WG for review and ownership.
- Joined the [CVE Outreach and Communications WG](https://www.cve.org/ProgramOrganization/WorkingGroups#OutreachandCommunicationsWorkingGroupOCWG)
  to review my guidance draft for Open Source orgs and projects becoming CNAs.

## Open Source Vulnerability Advisory Database

- Created [psf/advisory-database](https://github.com/psf/advisory-database) for tracking vulnerabilities in Python using OSV format.
- Imported existing CVEs for Python and advisory information from [python-security](https://python-security.readthedocs.io/) with approval from author.
  Manually imported some CVEs for Python which weren't documented there.
- [Collaborating with OSV team](https://github.com/google/osv.dev/issues/1552) to get advisories ingested into [osv.dev](https://osv.dev).

## Python Security Response Team

- Actively triaging disclosures for Python and pip via the Python Security Response Team (PSRT).
  Have been the active coordinator for all issues since joining PSRT.
- Coordinator for the [CVE-2023-40217](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/PEPLII27KYHLF4AK3ZQGKYNCRERG4YXY/) (HIGH)
  and [CVE-2023-41105](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/D6CDW3ZZC5D444YGL3VQUY6D4ECMCQLD/) (MEDIUM) vulnerabilities in Python.
  Coordinated remediation and disclosure between reporter, patch developers, and release managers.
- [Published my notes on the end-to-end vulnerability reporting and disclosure flow](https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-8#python-vulnerability-disclosure-end-to-end)
  and can now make recommendations for improvements to the PSRT process.

## Certifi and Truststore

- Identified [difficult chain of downstream requirements](https://sethmlarson.dev/security-developer-in-residence-weekly-report-7#certifi-and-truststore) whenever a certifi security advisory is published.
- This chain of events can be broken by using system trust stores (via the [Truststore](https://truststore.readthedocs.io/) library) instead of certifi CA bundle.
  Using system trust stores is better for applications in general due to PyPI no longer being a CA distribution channel.
- Truststore has recently received a large amount of passive users helping prove the technology thanks to PDM adopting the library. I've [recommended PDM adopt the library by default](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/issues/2195) for all users [to which they've agreed](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm/pull/2200), allowing to further prove Truststore's effectiveness.
- Pip [currently supports using Truststore as an option](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/topics/https-certificates/#using-system-certificate-stores), but I have a PR which [vendors Truststore](https://github.com/pypa/pip/pull/12107) thus allowing using it by default.
  - Required some extra work on Truststore's side to [ensure it continued to be vendorable by pip](https://github.com/sethmlarson/truststore/pull/108).
