like CPython and PyPI and the broader Python ecosystem in key areas, including:

* Conducting a security audit on PyPI
* Formalize and improve security practices for CPython, PyPI, and the broader Python community.
* Address security issues across PSF projects like CPython and PyPI and improve the ability to identify and resolve future issues.
* Establishing a security metric that allows them to show the sustained and renewable impact.
