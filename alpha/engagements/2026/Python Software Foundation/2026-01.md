### PyCon US "Trailblazing Python Security"

* Continuing to organize the inaugural security-themed talk track at PyCon US.
* Completed the first round of talk submissions (~50 submissions)
  between 5 reviewers. Round 2 is in progress, will have a complete talk track
  schedule finalized in early February.
* Plan is to publish blog posts leading up to PyCon US w/ schedule to get attendees
  excited to learn about security at PyCon US.

### EuroPython 2026

The Python Language Summit has been moved from only occurring
in the US to alternating between US and EU. This is the largest
convergence of Python core developers in the world, discussing
topics including security of the language and core workflow.
Seth submitted two talks to the EuroPython CFP and plans to
attend EuroPython and the Language Summit.

### Other items

* Authored the "security" section for the PSF Annual Impact Report.
* Submitted update on PSF activity regarding US 501c3 non-profits and
  Cyber Resilience Act "Attestation Programs". This is a sub-group of
  the CRA Attestations under the ORCWG.
* Began doing in-depth research on the `os.path.commonprefix()` API
  which was the source of the pip path traversal vulnerability.
  Potentially a future white paper topic.

## PyPI Safety & Security Engineer (Mike Fiedler)

Mike focused on advancing the Trusted Account Associations project,
improving malware detection infrastructure, and addressing performance bottlenecks in PyPI's APIs.

### Malware Response

January saw continued high malware report volume (360+), with significant time spent on security inbox triage.
The automated quarantine system continued operating with zero false positives for 52 packages.

Mike shipped a [Single Trusted Observer Quarantine](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19352) feature,
which will enable auto-quarantine based on reports from highly-trusted individual security researchers,
improving response times for confirmed newly-published malicious packages.

### Trusted Account Associations

Significant progress was made on the Sovereign Tech Agency-funded Trusted Account Associations project:

- [Shipped GitHub account associations](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19197) implementation using GitHub Apps
- [Refactored account associations](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19412) to enable shipping multiple providers
- Completed [GitLab account associations](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19298) implementation, pending GitLab.com assignment of `psf` namespace
- Started Google OAuth implementation for account linking

This work progresses toward adding more account details for "proofs"
and improving account recovery for those that have it.

### Security Infrastructure Improvements

Mike shipped several security and reliability improvements:

- Diagnosed database locking during uploads implemented a [10-minute upload timeout](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19283)
- Built and shipped the [Observation Insights dashboard](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19314) for analyzing malware reporter effectiveness
- [Disallowed excessively long recovery codes](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19300) to prevent potential abuse
- [Added proper typing to Observations and Events](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19358) for improved code safety
- Upgraded to [Python 3.13.11](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19188) and [Python 3.14.2](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19267)
- [Removed non-functioning Fastly Insights](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19369) code

### Performance Improvements

- [Improved simple HTML API response times by ~50%](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19341)
- [Increased search timeout](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19325) and authored [follow-up improvements](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/19326)
- Investigated search cluster failures and recommended infrastructure sizing changes and versions upgrades

### Community Engagement

- Participated in OpenSSF Securing Software Repositories working group meetings
- Attended Alpha-Omega public meetings and Package Manager meetings
- Contributed to Q4 Newsletter PyPI Updates

### Other Items

- [Store last email check timestamp](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19381) for deliverability monitoring
- [Restored inspector whitespace wrapping](https://github.com/pypi/inspector/pull/252)
- Contributed to [readme-renderer inline link anchors](https://github.com/pypa/readme_renderer/pull/351)
