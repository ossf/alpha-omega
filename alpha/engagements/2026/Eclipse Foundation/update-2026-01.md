# Rapid Security Reviews (RSR)

A Rapid Security Review is a time-boxed evaluation focused on key indicators of a project’s security posture. The goal was to provide a lightweight, repeatable process that helps projects quickly identify and address essential security gaps. Our goal is to incorporate the Rapid Security Review into the [Project Progress Review](https://www.eclipse.org/projects/handbook/#progress-review), a mandatory checkpoint that every Eclipse Foundation project must complete to remain active and in good standing.  
In parallel, we have started to work on tooling to help us streamline and standardize the collection of security relevant data in support of the review process. The tooling consolidates and normalizes data across platforms, thus reducing manual effort, increasing the completeness and timeliness of information available for analysis.

* Brainstorm RSR integration into Progress Reviews  
  * Defined a cross-team process for RSR integration into Progress Reviews, enabling consistent and repeatable execution  
  * New template draft  
  * Review Schedule for February  
* Scaffolding of automated tooling

# Project Identity Authority (PIA)

[PIA](https://github.com/eclipse-csi/pia) is a new initiative at the Eclipse Foundation inspired by the [trusted publishing principles](https://repos.openssf.org/trusted-publishers-for-all-package-repositories.html), but with an expanded scope. It functions as an authentication broker for Eclipse Foundation projects, leveraging OpenID Connect (OIDC).

PIA's purpose is twofold: to allow projects to authenticate when publishing artifacts and to provide verifiable proof that these artifacts originated from the project's official build infrastructure.

The initial implementation focuses on using PIA as an intermediary between the Eclipse Foundation's build infrastructure (such as GitHub Actions and Jenkins Pipelines) and the Eclipse DependencyTrack registry. This crucial step enables project-level access control for uploading SBOMs to DependencyTrack. Future plans include extending PIA's reach to other use cases that can benefit from this robust authentication mechanism.

* Published [design document](https://github.com/eclipse-csi/pia/pull/1)  
* Published [PoC](https://github.com/eclipse-csi/pia/pull/2)  
* Released [0.1.0 version](https://github.com/eclipse-csi/pia/releases/tag/v0.1.0) for early testing

# Releases Tracker

Accurate and automated tracking of software releases poses a significant challenge for organizations like the Eclipse Foundation, which manages a high volume of code repositories. The complexity is compounded by the publication of multiple artifacts (e.g., PyPI packages, Docker images, Maven artifacts) from a single repository, alongside the necessity of accommodating historical changes such as artifact renames and repository transfers.

To address this, we are exploring the concept of a "Release Tracker", an open source project aimed at defining a minimal metadata standard for inclusion in every software repository. When paired with an automated discovery tool, this initiative could transform release management from a manual, fragmented process into a scalable and auditable workflow.

This highly exploratory effort is also examining how Release Tracker metadata could streamline the adoption of SBOMs. Internal documentation and notes on these strategies are currently being elaborated and are slated for publication in February.
