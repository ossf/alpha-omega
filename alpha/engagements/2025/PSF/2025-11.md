### Malware Response

In November, Mike processed 178 malware reports,
with significant security inbox work accumulating during mid-month PTO.
Upon return, clearing the backlog consumed two full days.

Notable incidents included handling the "Shai Hulud" supply chain attack exposure,
which required investigation and remediation for affected PyPI user accounts.
Mike published a [blog post detailing PyPI's response](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-11-26-pypi-and-shai-hulud/).

Mike provided feedback to repeat reporters regarding report quality,
continuing efforts to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of inbound malware reports.
One user account alone generated 18 reports that were all false alarms,
highlighting the need for continued reporter education.
Automated quarantine continues to function effectively with zero false positives.

### Trusted Publishing Enhancements

Trusted Publishing continued to be a primary focus in November,
building on October's GitLab Self-Managed beta launch.
This work directly supports PyPI's goal of minimizing long-lived API tokens
in favor of secure, short-lived credentials for CI/CD providers.

Key deliverables:

- Released [Pending Organization Publishers](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19005),
  a significant feature enabling organizations to pre-configure trusted publishers
  before projects exist. This streamlines onboarding for teams adopting Trusted Publishing.
- Published a [blog post](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-11-10-trusted-publishers-coming-to-orgs/)
  highlighting Trusted Publishing adoption metrics and announcing
  GitLab Self-Managed support for enterprise users
- Added [functional tests for Trusted Publishing](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19000),
  improving test coverage and catching edge cases
- Implemented [confirmation dialog for Trusted Publisher removal](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19001)
  to prevent accidental deletions that could break CI/CD pipelines
- Promoted releases via social media to increase community adoption

### Trusted Account Associations

Mike began work on Trusted Account Associations, a new feature enabling users to link
external accounts (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Google) with their PyPI accounts.
This should improve account recovery options and enable future verification mechanisms.

Mike authored the [main tracking issue](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/19026)
and set up a [milestone](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/milestone/18) for the project.
Initial work began on the [Account Associations data model](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19053),
with the design generalized to support alternate verification mechanisms in the future.

### Security Infrastructure Improvements

- [Added login validation to prevent email addresses in username field](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19012),
  addressing a common user error pattern
- [Collected OTP sync issue metrics](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18981)
  to diagnose authentication timing problems
- Reviewed and merged security scanning improvements for `linehaul`, including zizmor integration
- [Fixed inspector encoding detection](https://github.com/pypi/inspector/pull/248) issues

### Community Engagement

- Attended Alpha-Omega and OpenSSF monthly meetings
- Participated in Fast Forward Registry Roundtable hosted by Fastly

### Other Items

- Converted [Warehouse documentation from Sphinx to MkDocs](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18977) to bypass a dependency issue
- [Removed intermediary pip-compile script](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18979),
  simplifying dependency management
- [Removed deprecated cryptography `default_backend`](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18980) from OTP module
- [Removed `docReady` JavaScript helper](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18991)
  in favor of native `defer` attribute
- Added [organizations profile feature to display project summary](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18998)
- Investigated [dependency injection issue](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/19033)

  and [added database index](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19056)
- Routine [Dependabot updates](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19004)
- [Code review for refactor](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19027#pullrequestreview-3444863292)
