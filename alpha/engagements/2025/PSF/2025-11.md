# Update 2025-11

## Security Developer-in-Residence (Seth Larson)

### Python Security Response Team (PSRT)

Discussion of the PEP [formalizing the PSRT workflow, onboarding, and expectations](https://peps.python.org/pep-0811/) (PEP 811) has wrapped up.
Seth has [submitted the PEP to the Steering Council](https://github.com/python/steering-council/issues/323) for final review.
It's unlikely that a vote will be taken until the next
Steering Council is seated as an election is currently
underway so we're expecting a result in early 2026.

The PEP was finalized with the following:

- 90 day timeline for vulnerability reports aligning to industry standards.
- Adopting GitHub Security Advisories as the primary reporting
  and coordinating mechanism.
- Process for onboarding and offboarding members of the PSRT
  including a nomination and two-thirds acceptance vote, barring
  veto from the Steering Council, similar to core team membership votes.
- Public list of PSRT members to be published.
- Expectations of participation as a coordinator of a vulnerability
  with a yearly audit of membership conducted by PSRT admins and
  removal recommendations to be approved by the Steering Council, if any.

Work to prepare for the PEP's acceptance and implementation is already underway.
Seth collaborated with the PSF infrastructure engineer Jacob Coffee to
further develop Python's bot for GitHub Security Advisories to implement the 90 day
deadline reminders and allow GHSA collaborators to control GHSA without
being an admin. This is important, as these features are not available for GHSA
out-of-the-box and works around multiple missing features and APIs in GHSA.

Our plan is to publish this bot publicly so other organizations can take advantage.

## PyPI Safety & Security Engineer (Mike Fiedler)

### Malware Response

In November, Mike processed 178 malware reports,
with significant security inbox work accumulating during mid-month PTO.
Upon return, clearing the backlog consumed two full days.

Notable incidents included handling the "Shai Hulud" supply chain attack exposure,
which required investigation and remediation for affected PyPI user accounts.
Mike published a [blog post detailing PyPI's response](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-11-26-pypi-and-shai-hulud/).

Mike provided feedback to repeat reporters regarding report quality,
continuing efforts to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of inbound malware reports.
One user account alone generated 18 reports that were all false alarms,
highlighting the need for continued reporter education.
Automated quarantine continues to function effectively with zero false positives.

### Trusted Publishing Enhancements

Trusted Publishing continued to be a primary focus in November,
building on October's GitLab Self-Managed beta launch.
This work directly supports PyPI's goal of minimizing long-lived API tokens
in favor of secure, short-lived credentials for CI/CD providers.

Key deliverables:

- Released [Pending Organization Publishers](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19005),
  a significant feature enabling organizations to pre-configure trusted publishers
  before projects exist. This streamlines onboarding for teams adopting Trusted Publishing.
- Published a [blog post](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-11-10-trusted-publishers-coming-to-orgs/)
  highlighting Trusted Publishing adoption metrics and announcing
  GitLab Self-Managed support for enterprise users
- Added [functional tests for Trusted Publishing](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19000),
  improving test coverage and catching edge cases
- Implemented [confirmation dialog for Trusted Publisher removal](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19001)
  to prevent accidental deletions that could break CI/CD pipelines
- Promoted releases via social media to increase community adoption

### Trusted Account Associations

Mike began work on Trusted Account Associations, a new feature enabling users to link
external accounts (e.g. GitHub, GitLab, Google) with their PyPI accounts.
This should improve account recovery options and enable future verification mechanisms.

Mike authored the [main tracking issue](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/19026)
and set up a [milestone](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/milestone/18) for the project.
Initial work began on the [Account Associations data model](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19053),
with the design generalized to support alternate verification mechanisms in the future.

### Security Infrastructure Improvements

- [Added login validation to prevent email addresses in username field](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19012),
  addressing a common user error pattern
- [Collected OTP sync issue metrics](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18981)
  to diagnose authentication timing problems
- Reviewed and merged security scanning improvements for `linehaul`, including zizmor integration
- [Fixed inspector encoding detection](https://github.com/pypi/inspector/pull/248) issues

### Community Engagement

- Attended Alpha-Omega and OpenSSF monthly meetings
- Participated in Fast Forward Registry Roundtable hosted by Fastly

### Other Items

- Converted [Warehouse documentation from Sphinx to MkDocs](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18977) to bypass a dependency issue
- [Removed intermediary pip-compile script](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18979),
  simplifying dependency management
- [Removed deprecated cryptography `default_backend`](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18980) from OTP module
- [Removed `docReady` JavaScript helper](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18991)
  in favor of native `defer` attribute
- Added [organizations profile feature to display project summary](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/18998)
- Investigated [dependency injection issue](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/issues/19033)
  with [PR #19055](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19055)
  and [added database index](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19056)
- Routine [Dependabot updates](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19004)
- [Code review for refactor](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19027#pullrequestreview-3444863292)

Mike took one week of paid time off (November 17-21) for vacation.
