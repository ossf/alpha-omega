# Update 2025-12

## PyPI Safety & Security Engineer (Mike Fiedler)

Mike returned from two weeks of travel, including AWS re:Invent and DevOpsDays Tel Aviv.

### Malware Response

December saw a high malware report volume, with over **300 inbound reports**.
The automated quarantine system proved highly effective, catching **over 50 malicious projects** with zero false positives.
This demonstrated the system's reliability and reduced manual intervention requirements during periods of reduced availability,
and accounted for over 100 of the inbound reports (since multiple reports triggered quarantines).

Mike continued responding to security inbox items throughout the month despite holiday scheduling,
maintaining PyPI's security posture through the year-end period.

The high volume of inbound reports has created a backlog for triage,
and Mike is balancing that backlog with forward-looking work,
expecting to complete the backlog by the end of January.

### Trusted Account Associations

Mike made significant progress on the Trusted Account Associations project
This work enables users to associate external accounts with their PyPI identity,
improving account recovery options and laying groundwork for enhanced verification features.

Key deliverables included:

- Merged the [account associations data model](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19053), establishing the foundation for account linking
- Split and refined commits for [draft review of the implementation](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19197)
- Updated the implementation to use a GitHub App instead of OAuth App, future-proofing the integration
- Added email notification support for account association events

- Shipped a [urllib3 update](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19158) resolving 14 security alerts
- Fixed a [ReDoS vulnerability in email regex](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19211) used by admin services

discovered during routine security analysis,
demonstrating continued vigilance in protecting the broader Python ecosystem.
