# Update 2025-12

## PyPI Safety & Security Engineer (Mike Fiedler)

Mike returned from two weeks of travel, including AWS re:Invent and DevOpsDays Tel Aviv.

### Malware Response

December saw a high malware report volume, with over **300 inbound reports**.
The automated quarantine system proved highly effective, catching **over 50 malicious projects** with zero false positives.
This demonstrated the system's reliability and reduced manual intervention requirements during periods of reduced availability,
and accounted for over 100 of the inbound reports (since multiple reports triggered quarantines).

Mike continued responding to security inbox items throughout the month despite holiday scheduling,
maintaining PyPI's security posture through the year-end period.

The high volume of inbound reports has created a backlog for triage,
and Mike is balancing that backlog with forward-looking work,
expecting to complete the backlog by the end of January.

### Trusted Account Associations

Mike made significant progress on the Trusted Account Associations project
This work enables users to associate external accounts with their PyPI identity,
improving account recovery options and laying groundwork for enhanced verification features.

Key deliverables included:

- Merged the [account associations data model](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19053), establishing the foundation for account linking
- Split and refined commits for [draft review of the implementation](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19197)
- Updated the implementation to use a GitHub App instead of OAuth App, future-proofing the integration
- Added email notification support for account association events

### Security Infrastructure Improvements

Mike addressed multiple security concerns across PyPI's codebase:

- Shipped a [urllib3 update](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19158) resolving 14 security alerts
- Fixed a [ReDoS vulnerability in email regex](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19211) used by admin services
- [Restricted permissions](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19212) in development environment GitHub workflows
- Resolved a [missing CSP directive](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19167) for the fundraiser feature
- [Updated JavaScript dependencies](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19203) to unblock UI development
- Fixed NGWAF skipping for iframe rendering in admin UI
- Reviewed and deployed [lxml update](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19217)
- Code reviewed [admin interface IP ban/unban feature](https://github.com/pypi/warehouse/pull/19213#pullrequestreview-3605416470)

Mike also identified and reported a project's Supabase API key exposure,
discovered during routine security analysis,
demonstrating continued vigilance in protecting the broader Python ecosystem.

## Security Developer-in-Residence (Seth Larson)

- Authored and submitted end-of-year report for Alpha-Omega 2025 engagement.
  Using this end-of-year report for the Python Software Foundation
  Annual Impact Report 2025 security topic.
- [PEP 811](https://peps.python.org/pep-0811/) (Python Security Response Team membership and operations)
  was accepted by the Python Steering Council. This PEP will allow Seth
  to continue improving the Python Security Response team operations
  in 2026 by adopting GitHub Security Advisories and a policy for adding
  new members and removing inactive members.
- Published a [retrospective update on PEP 770](https://sethmlarson.dev/pep-770-sbom-data-from-pypi-fedora-and-redhat)
  (Software Bill-of-Materials for Python packages) with the following updates:
  - Auditwheel and cibuildwheel Python tools have begun generating SBOM data
    for Python packages automatically. This data can be seen within the py-code.org
    dataset.
  - Fedora, CentOS, and RedHat have [adopted PEP 770 in their Python packages](https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2025/12/15/how-reduce-false-positives-security-scans)
    and are requesting feedback on their implementation. This was done to fix
    an issue of scanners erroneously detecting RPM-based Python packages which
    had security fixes backported as vulnerable.
- Assisted in the upgrade of PyPI to Python 3.13.11 which had some incompatibilities
  between PyPI's intense ZIP-vetting process and the new security fixes regarding
  ZIP64 EOCD Locator records.
- Coordinated and reviewed the PyCon US "[Trailblazing Python Security](https://pycon.blogspot.com/2025/11/trailblazing-python-security-pycon-us-2026.html)" talk track
  submissions. This included finding reviewers and talk submitters, helping
  them through the process, and then manually reviewing all talks.
- Reviewed [PyPI's 2025 End of Year review](https://blog.pypi.org/posts/2025-12-31-pypi-2025-in-review/) blog post which highlights security work.
- Published three security advisories for CPython:
  - [CVE-2025-13836](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/OQ6G7MKRQIS3OAREC3HNG3D2DPOU34XO/): Excessive read buffering DoS in `http.client`

  - [CVE-2025-12084](https://mail.python.org/archives/list/security-announce@python.org/thread/GVKCSONQH5JRWEUCUCO76UVSPL7CGMYM/): Quadratic complexity in node ID cache clearing
