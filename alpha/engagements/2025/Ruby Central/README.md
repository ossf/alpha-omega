## Ruby Central

Our engagement with Alpha-Omega focuses on improving security in the Ruby ecosystem.  For 2025, we have the following active grants.

* Samuel Giddins' staffing as our security engineer in residence
* Marty Haught's expanded role to establish a security culture and operationalize security
* Infrastructure Security - SSO

### Timeline

Marty's staffing expansion started in December 2024. Samuel's staffing is a continuation from 2024 under the same role sponsored by AWS.

The first phase of the Infrastructure Security work focused on SSO access is estimated to start in May 2025 once another project wraps up.
