# Update 2025-11

## Security Engineer

We expanded the hiring process to a 4 interview loop.  We now have two technical interviews, the first focusing on Ruby and Ruby on Rails security and the second focusing on infrastructure security.  The technical exercises are ready and the interviewers have been selected.  We expect to share the job post in December.

## Open Source Committee & Governance

Richard Schneeman, a respected Rubyist in the open source community, and Bruno Miranda, SVP of Engineering at Doximity, have joined the Open Source Committee.  They drafted a proposed governance structure that is going through internal review before we share it publicly.  The expected timeline is in the next few weeks.

### Operational Transition

We had smooth operations in November.  We’ve begun training to add 4 additional operators in December, bringing the primary and secondary rotations to 10 total.  The team feels confident this is a sustainable rotation.  The other notable effort was to improve the monitoring of our key service metrics in Datadog. We expect to complete this effort in December.  Marty will put together a short-term operational fitness plan to address any remaining gaps in operations and security.

## 2026 roadmap and strategy
Marty is preparing a board presentation on the 2026 plan for December 18th. We will continue with our three pillars of supply chain security, operational excellence, and platform sustainability.
