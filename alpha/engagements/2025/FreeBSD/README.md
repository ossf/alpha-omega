## Notes on the FreeBSD Security team and policies

The [FreeBSD Security Team](https://www.freebsd.org/administration/#t-secteam)
oversees the identification, mitigation, and disclosure of security
vulnerabilities within the FreeBSD operating system. They provide timely
security advisories, coordinate responses to reported vulnerabilities, and
maintain a comprehensive security infrastructure to safeguard FreeBSD systems.
Users can access security advisories, security officer reports, and information
on security policies and best practices to ensure the security and integrity of
their FreeBSD deployments.

The [FreeBSD vulnerability reporting and disclosure
policy](https://www.freebsd.org/security/reporting/) provides guidelines for
responsible disclosure, including how to securely communicate vulnerabilities to
the FreeBSD Security Team. Additionally, it details the process followed by the
Security Team for evaluating, addressing, and disclosing reported
vulnerabilities, ensuring timely and transparent handling of security issues
within the FreeBSD community.
