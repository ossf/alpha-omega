# Eclipse Foundation Update — November 2025

## Otterdog

* Continued development on Otterdog: several commits have been made with quality of life improvements for users (better error handling, more explanatory warning messages, fixes). A new version `v1.1.1` has been [released](https://github.com/eclipse-csi/otterdog/releases/tag/v1.1.1).

* 37 GH configurations changes have been processed by Otterdog

* While exact details per commit are not broken out here, the pattern of continuous improvement — bug-fixes, feature tweaks, configuration enhancements — is clear.
  
* Improved management of GitHub Advisories via Otterdog: now tracking "last comment date" which helps in advisory triage and ensures we are aware of stale/active discussions.

## Communication

* Published [blog on open-source stewards](https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/marta-rybczynska/understanding-open-source-stewards-and-cyber-resilience-act) and the CRA to announce this white paper.
