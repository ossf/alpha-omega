## Otterdog

* 63 GH configurations changes have been processed by Otterdog

## Open VSX

* Processed 21 malwares. Slightly down from September’s 29 but still high.

## Infrastructure

* Domain & Cloudflare domain fleet: we are now managing 134 domains via Cloudflare with standardadized configuration as code:
  * HSTS header enforcement
  * Only TLS 1.2 / 1.3 allowed
  * HTTP redirect → HTTPS
  * Blocking ports that Cloudflare opens (minimising exposure)
  * Redirecting only HTTPS to designated URLs (no redirect from HTTP)
