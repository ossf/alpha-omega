# Eclipse Foundation Update — July 2025

* Published new video resources on security training, vulnerability management, and SBOMs: https://blogs.eclipse.org/post/marta-rybczynska/security-training-vulnerability-management-and-sboms-videos-are-online

* On the Otterdog front, we've had a contribution via [PR #474](https://github.com/eclipse-csi/otterdog/pull/474/files) that adds GitHub Pages visibility setting for enterprise orgs

* 70 GH configurations changes have been processed by Otterdog

* Completed our first code-signing certificate renewal and rotation since migrating to Google KMS. This demonstrates that our secure key infrastructure is fully operational (not just deployed, but now exercised) and certificate lifecycle management is in place.
