# Eclipse Foundation Update — September 2025

## Team

* A new team member, Lukas Puehringer, has joined the team. Lukas brings a wealth of experience on supply chain security tooling, being a maintainer of in-toto and RS-TUF.

## Otterdog

* Released Otterdog [v1.1.0](https://github.com/eclipse-csi/otterdog/releases/tag/v1.1.0). Major changes include:
  * Add support for marking organizations as archived and to ignore them
  * Add new check-status CLI command. This outputs a json file of with sync, validation, and archival status of organizations
  * Make the sync-check always succeed to not prevent PRs from being merged due to unrelated changes in the live settings.

* 42 GH configurations changes have been processed by Otterdog

## Open VSX

* In the context of the Open VSX registry, processed 29 malwares, a significant jump from August (13 → 29).

* To improve detection of exposed tokens going forward, we introduced a **token prefix format** (in collaboration with Microsoft’s MSRC) to enable easier and more accurate scanning for exposed tokens across public repos. This adds a proactive detection capability for credential leakage.

## Infrastructure

* Internal DNS infrastructure migration to strengthen our internal reliability and auditability: replaced aging Bind9 with **PowerDNS**. This brought:

  * container-based deployment (better consistency/automation)
  * fault-tolerant setup with high-availability in mind
  * a modern web UI with versioning and traceability.
