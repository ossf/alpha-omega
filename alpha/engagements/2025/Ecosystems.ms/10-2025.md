## Update October 2025

### API Policy

Our API plans are available at https://ecosyste.ms/pricing. Users can log in and manage their accounts at https://ecosyste.ms/login. Users can sign in using their GitHub account, select plans and pay for them using Stripe's payment processors. 

We will launch paid for tiers in November. 


### Contributor Guidance

Our documentation site is now available at https://docs.ecosyste.ms/docs/. Basic documentation is available for each of the services, indexes, and products, alongside information about the ecosyste.ms project. 

We hope to complete this SoW in November. 

### Governance

After a couple of iterations the team published its [Charter](https://docs.ecosyste.ms/docs/about/charter) and its initial [governance process](https://docs.ecosyste.ms/docs/about/governance).

Our governance processes are, at this early stage, intentionally light. We establish a governance committee, tasked with financial and operational responsibilities while the technical steering committee support the community of maintainers and publish a roadmap. Maintainers are considered members and may vote in elections to either committee. Sponsors may be invited to join as member of either committee but sponsorship does not guarantee membership.

This SoW is considered delivered.
