Gitlab support for Trusted Publishing is now officially in a public beta testing period. There is now a working prototype of Capslock for Rust. Code is being written for crates.io vulnerability surfacing. There is now a bunch of anomaly detection happening for crates.io.

## Trusted Publishing

Gitlab support for Trusted Publishing is now officially in a [public beta testing](https://crates.io/docs/trusted-publishing) period. The plan is for developers who use Gitlab to try Trusted Publishing and provide any actionable feedback. The expectation is that this will remain in beta until mid-January.

Tobias implemented a [flag](https://rust-lang.zulipchat.com/user_uploads/thumbnail/4715/jqdxvNjjyenlMlyzwuckqAHg/image.png/840x560.webp) to allow crate owners to [enforce](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/issues/12361) Trusted Publishing for their specific crates.

Crates-io Trusted publishing can now be [configured](https://github.com/rust-lang/team/pull/2078) as IaC via the team repo for the crates owned by the Rust Project. Marco and other Rust Project infra team members have made configuring trusted publishing easier, more auditable and more reliable, as we can make sure that there are no drifts in the configuration.

There is now a [user id query parameter](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/12433) that allows users to avoid N+1 queries for Trusted Publishing configurations. Tobias added support for a `?user_id=123` query parameter to the Trusted Publishing config listing endpoints. This user ID only accepts the user ID of the currently authenticated user and will list the configurations of all the crates of which the user is an owner.

## Capslock

Adam has implemented a working prototype of Capslock. You can see a demo of it [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SK16lPih9h0AthTBhZAuRQxO3l5nR7sm/view?usp=drive_link) showing the concept proved out. There are [Painter](https://github.com/rustfoundation/painter)/LLVM integrations.

The next steps are to wrap everything up into a standalone tool and integrate the implementation with broader tooling for security advisories, which will use work from crates.io vulnerability surfacing.

## Vulnerability Surfacing

The crates.io vulnerability surfacing [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/3872) is moving into the Final Comment Period (FCP) stage. It just requires a few more approvals and then the RFC will hit its last approval stage.

On the assumption that the RFC will be approved. the implementation work has [begun](https://github.com/rust-lang/crates.io/pull/12311).

## Other Engineering

### Analytics

Walter has implemented crate and log analytics within DataDog. He is looking for anomalies across the top 500 crates. For example, if a crate has some task accomplished from an ip address that is not normally used for development of that crate, the it will be logged and flagged. There is also AI detection as well. We now are gathering and parsing metrics to see what AI user agents are doing against our crates.io APIs and what they are actually reading.

### Automating Foundation Infrastructure

Walter is building out Terraform for the Rust Foundation for things like user management. He is implementing CI/CD-based RBAC and enrollment for internal Foundation and Rust Innovation Lab projects.

## Announcements and Community

### C++/Rust Interop

Jon was involved in two proposals for the C++ standardization committee (WG21) which was presented at the recent meeting the first week of November. The primary proposal written by Jon was ["Safety Strategy Requirements for C++"](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3874r0.pdf) which is an appeal for C++ to set a direction for building a new language subset to enable safety-by-construction akin to default, safe Rust. A very [key result](https://github.com/cplusplus/papers/issues/2475) came out of Jon’s safety strategy requirements for C++ paper and presentation. Jon worked all week to get consensus in order to have the WG21 to agree to pursue a safe subset similar to what exists in Rust with respect to memory safety (or UB freedom). Another paper that Jon had input was ["A Lifetime-Management Primitive for Trivially Relocatable Types"](https://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2025/p3858r0.pdf), which aims to improve the Rust usability for a new category of types defined in the C++26 standard. That will very likely be tabled until C++29.

### The Rust Project is now using main

Through a huge community effort, the `rust-lang/rust` primary branch was [renamed](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/148564) to `main`.
